			<p>1 March 2020, the Mimouna Club of AUI organized a trip to Casablanca, where the present members had the opportunity to visit some important Jewish sites in Morocco's largest city. We started by visiting the Museum of Morocco Judaisme. After a warm welcome from Ms. Zhor Rehihil, we had the opportunity to discuss different components of the Museum as well as the history of its creation. The group was educated on the achievements of Simon Levy, a famous Moroccan political figure who dreamt of immortalizing Jewish heritage in the Arab world. Currently, this museum is the only one of its kind.</p>
